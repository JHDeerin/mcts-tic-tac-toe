# MCTS Tic-Tac-Toe

A Monte Carlo Tree Search agent that can - completely unnecessarily - play tic-tac-toe.

There are much simpler exhaustive search techniques that can play tic-tac-toe perfectly, but this helped me understand how MCTS works and is hopefully a stepping stone to higher things.

## Local Installation (for developers)

1. Clone this repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/JHDeerin/mcts-tic-tac-toe
```

2. Install the required Python 3 packages.
```
pip install pytest
```

3. Run Pytest and make sure everything's passing.
```
pytest
```

Now you can play tic-tac-toe against the AI!

```
python play.py
```
